#  GitHub Directory Downloader

Download a **single folder** from any public GitHub repository â€” as a `.zip`, instantly.

GitHub doesnâ€™t natively support downloading individual directories, which can be inconvenient when you just need a few files from a large project.  
This tool solves that.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

Just paste the link to a GitHub folder â€” and get a ZIP archive of its contents in one click.

You can use the UI or go directly via URL parameters.
